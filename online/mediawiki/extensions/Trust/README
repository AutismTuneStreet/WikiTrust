Custom Coloring Extensions

Trust3.php -- Does the coloring markup and revision tracking
NotifyEdit -- Sends a UDP message to a specified server whenever a edit happens.

To install and configure Trust3.php (this will color new revisions as
they are created.): 

This assumes a correctly configured and installed MediaWiki
installation.

1) Copy Trust3.php to (Dir of MediaWiki)/extensions/Trust/Trust3php

2) Copy ExtensionClass.php to extensions/ExtensionClass.php

3) Edit following 2 lines in Trust3.php:

## Path to eval_online_wiki
$EVAL_ONLINE_WIKI = "/home/ipye/git/wikitrust/online/analysis/eval_online_wiki";

## Median file cache lives here
$EVAL_MEDIAN_REP_FILE = "/tmp/mw_median_rep";

here, make sure that the apache user process can write to /tmp.

Also, make sure that the apache user process can execute the
eval_online_wiki program.

3) Add the following lines to LocalSettings.php:

require_once( $IP . "/extensions/ExtensionClass.php");
require_once( $IP . "/extensions/Trust/Trust3.php" );

4) Try creating a new revision. It should be colored as soon as it is
created. 

Finally, for speed, make sure that you are using a native code version
of eval_online_wiki.

If you have problems, look in /tmp/coloring.log (or the value you set
$EVAL_ONLINE_LOG_FILE for debugging information).

Trouble Shooting:

1) If you click on the trust tab immediatly after editing a wiki and
 the text is not colored, wait 1 minuet and then touch
 LocalSettings.php. Sometimes the coloring takes a while, and you will
 need to touch the file to defeat the caching in this case.
