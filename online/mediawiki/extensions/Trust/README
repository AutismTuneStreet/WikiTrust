Trust Coloring Extensions

To install and configure the trust coloring extensions, proceed as
follows.  This assumes a correctly configured and installed MediaWiki
installation.

1) Copy Trust3.php to (directory of MediaWiki)/extensions/Trust/Trust3php

2) Copy ExtensionClass.php to 
(directory of MediaWiki)extensions/Trust/ExtensionClass.php

3) Add the following lines, appropriately edited, to
LocalSettings.php: 

# Trust extension	
$wgUseTidy = true;
$wgTrustCmd = "/home/luca/wikitrust/online/analysis/eval_online_wiki"; 
$wgTrustLog = "/tmp/{$wgDBname}-trust.log";
require_once( $IP . "/extensions/Trust/ExtensionClass.php");
require_once( $IP . "/extensions/Trust/Trust3.php" );

If you don't wish to obtain a log, you can safely set: 
$wgTrustLog = "/dev/null';
In fact, if you do get a log, it is your responsibility to set up the
proper log rotation and compression scripts.  The only purpose of the 
log is to help in debugging. 
$wgTrustCommand is the name of the trust coloring executable; 

4) Try creating a new revision. It should be colored as soon as it is
created. 

Finally, for speed, make sure that you are using a native code version
of eval_online_wiki.

If you have problems, look in /tmp/coloring.log (or the value you set
$EVAL_ONLINE_LOG_FILE for debugging information).

Trouble Shooting:

1) If you click on the trust tab immediatly after editing a wiki and
 the text is not colored, wait 1 minute and then touch
 LocalSettings.php. Sometimes the coloring takes a while, and you will
 need to touch the file to defeat the caching in this case.
