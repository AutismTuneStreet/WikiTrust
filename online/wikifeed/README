Code which sets up an online feed from wikipedia to you. 

Requirements : mediawiki, mysql, with a mediawiki installation all set up.

To work, first copy pull_revision.ini.sample into online_feed_test and 
update the values defined there. Point to the db created by mediawiki.

Then, run the sql file ../sql/online_analysis.sql, creating the needed tables inside the same db as
mediawiki.

Now, you are ready to go!

Run with:

python ./set_test.py --use_dump 'dump to color' --eval_wiki 'path to the
eval_online_wiki executable'

This will call the online_db code with each revision in the dump file.

For examlpe:

 ./set_test.py -v --use_dump /home/ipye/enwiki-20080103-0020009.xml.gz --eval_wiki  \
 ../analysis/eval_online_wiki

Note that the other files in this directory are experimental, and are not used right now.
