1. Download revisions.

   Martin Walker says in an email from 24-April-2009, that there are
   two ways to get the list of titles being included in Wikipedia-0.7:
	http://toolserver.org/~cbm/release-data/release.20081213.gz
	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:SelectionBot/0.7alpha

2. Ensure that we have latest revisions.

   Given a list of page titles, we first need to make sure that
   the latest revisions of each page have been downloaded by
   our system.

	$ zcat release.20081213.gz | ./extract-wp0.7-articles.pl | ./preload_dispatcher_queue.pl
