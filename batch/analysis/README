On compiling and GODI

You now need a set of packages in order to complile the code base. These are:

netclient
extlib

These can be downloaded and compliled from source, but I don't recommend it. A better way is to use GODI.

GODI is a package manager, on the order of mac ports or perl's cpan.

To use:

Download from http://godi.camlcity.org/godi/index.html

Now,

1. Extract the bootstrap tarball:
    gzip -d godi-bootstrap-<VERSION>.tar.gz 
    tar xf godi-bootstrap-<VERSION>.tar 
    cd godi-bootstrap-<VERSION>
   
2. Enter stage 1:
    ./bootstrap --prefix <PREFIX>
  
3. Adjust PATH, optionally edit <PREFIX>/etc/godi.conf:
   PATH=<PREFIX>/bin:<PREFIX>/sbin:$PATH 
   export PATH
  
4. Enter stage 2 (a working Internet connection is required):
  ./bootstrap_stage2 

See http://godi.camlcity.org/godi/user-doc/umanual.html#htoc3
For a full list of options for each bootstrap set.

Note that godi will install a new version of ocaml and assorted helper funtions in the <PREFIX> given at 2. 
I reccomend removeing any pre-existing ocaml instalations before proceeding, to avoid confusion.

After stage 4, a minimal set of packages is installed. 

All that's left is to install extlib:

1) Launch godi_console 

2) After starting godi_console type «2» to enter the menu «Select source packages». 
   The list of available and installed packages appears (shown in figure 1.1). You can 
   select (and deselect) packages by entering the number and typing «b» to build the package, 
   «k» to keep the package as it is, 
   or «r» to remove the package (in the corresponding submenu). 
   Finally, press «s» to start the installation, a procedure comprising the following steps:

* GODI checks the package dependencies. Missing packages are implicitly
  selected for build. Furthermore, if a package is rebuilt, all installed packages are checked whether 
  they are dependent on this package, and also rebuilt. The same «expansion» of the update plan 
  is performed for the packages scheduled for removal.
* When the dependencies had to be corrected, the package list is
  displayed again, and the additionally affected packages are shown at the top of the list. 
  In this case, type again «s» to restart the resolution of dependencies.
* Finally, the update plan is executed: Missing software is
  retrieved from the Internet. Old packages are removed. The new packages are extracted, built, 
  and installed. These actions are always performed automatically, 
  without any need for the users to gear into the running process.
