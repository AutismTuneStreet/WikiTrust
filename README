WikiTrust consists of two bodies of code: a batch one, and an online
one. 

The batch system enables you to analyze wikis in batch fashion, and
can be used to compute many quantities of interest, such as text
origin, analize reversions, detect edit wars, and much more. 
To install the batch system, follow the instructions in the
batch/README directory. 

The online system enables you to compute and display text trust in
real-time, as edits to the wiki are made.  The online system also
computes author reputations, and it tracks, for each word, the
revision where the word was originated. 
To install the online system, follow the instructions in the
online/README directory.
