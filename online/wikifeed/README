Code which sets up an online feed from wikipedia to you. 

These are at quite a preliminary stage.

To work, first copy pull_revision.ini.sample into pull_revision.ini and 
update the values defined there.

SETUP AND RUN A TEST FEED EVALUATION:
python ./set_test.py --use_dump 'dump to color' --eval_wiki 'path to the
eval_online_wiki' executable

CURRENT ISSUES:

1) UserID is not pulled -- all userids are set to NULL 

NOTES:

To run:

python pull_text.py -v (verbose) -d (run as deamon)

python pull_revisions.py -v (verbose)

These scripts assume the existance (and writablity) of the /tmp 
directory.

Additionally, mysql is a requirement.
