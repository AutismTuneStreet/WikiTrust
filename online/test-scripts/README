This directory contains code that can be used to load an xml database
dump into a wiki. 

Requirements : mediawiki, mysql, with a mediawiki installation all set up.

To work, first copy db_access_data.ini.sample into db_access_data.ini and
update the values defined there with the information about the
database created by mediawiki. 

To populate the database, use the command: 

  $ ./load_data.py <dump_1.xml> ... <dump_n.xml> 

If you wish to delete the wiki content before loading the files
(CAREFUL WITH THIS!!), use the --clear_db option: 

  $ ./load_data.py --clear_db <dump_1.xml> ... <dump_n.xml> 


The file load_and_run.sh.template can be used to test the WikiTrust code. 
To do so, copy it into load_and_run.sh, and run it. 
Note that the script runs eval_online_wiki in debug mode, via
ocamldebug, so the script is not useful to only for code debugging. 
If you wish to first load a wiki, then color it, you should use
load_data.py to load the wiki, and eval_online_wiki to color it as
explained in the README file in the parent directory.
